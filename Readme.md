### Steps:

### 01 generate synthetic data
- In cases where we have a large amount of data, we can generate synthetic data to train our model. This is done by using a tool like GPT-3.5 Turbo or GPT-4 to generate data based on a prompt.
- We therefore do not need to manually prepare the data.

<!-- 02 train model
03 test model
04 deploy model -->
